a) If the program executes correctly or not 
- The following program ran very smooth by following the given instructions. It ran well on Ripes.me with the output being: 
- (g+h)-(i+j)= -4\


b) If yes, five screenshots showing the successful execution of your program 
- I used the screenshot feature on my computer to show that the program ran successfully 5 times. It is included in my ZIP file.\


c) Anything you want me to know about your program development and execution 
- During the development of this very simple program, I used the course book called "Computer Organization and Design" by Patterson and Hennessy.
- The course book was very useful in creating such a simple code. Especially the second chapter. 

d) Contributions of teammates if there are multiple 
- Nobody else worked on this project with me, I did the screenshots, code, and this README file.
